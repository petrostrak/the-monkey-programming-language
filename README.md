# The Monkey programming language
The Monkey Programming Language &amp; Interpreter

This is the code from version 1 of the [Writing an interpreter and a compiler in Go by Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).We build a programming language from scratch. We end up with a fully working interpreter for the Monkey programming language. We build the lexer, the parser, the AST, the object system, and the evaluator â€” written with tests first and without 3rd-party libraries. The next step in the evolution of the Monkey programming language: we're switching out the tree-walking evaluator for a bytecode compiler and virtual machine.
